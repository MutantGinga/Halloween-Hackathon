Halloween Hackathon
-------------------

_**Hauntography**_ is a game that two friends and I made for a Halloween 2024 Hackathon run by the Computing Society at the University of Derby. The game was made in 24 hours, along with a trailer to showcase the project, and **won the competition**!

In the game, you explore a cemetery while solving riddles to find ghosts. When you find the ghosts, you can take a picture of them with your camera. Find and take a picture of all three ghosts to win!
